.SYNOPSIS
    Backup DNS records from a DNS server (including AD-integrated zones).

.DESCRIPTION
    This script enumerates all DNS zones from a specified DNS server, 
    then retrieves all records from each zone using Get-DnsServerResourceRecord.
    It stores them in a JSON file, which can be restored later with the companion script.

.PARAMETER DnsServer
    The hostname or IP of the DNS server.

.PARAMETER BackupFile
    The path to the JSON file that will store the DNS record backup.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Backup-DnsRecords.ps1 -DnsServer "localhost" -BackupFile "C:\dns\DNSBackup.json"

    Backs up all DNS records on "localhost" into "C:\dns\DNSBackup.json".
